# Counterfactual_Explanation_for_deep_learning
In the second part of the test, we will be using heart failure clinical record data set. We will be using artificial neural network and Bidirectional LSTM for prediction whether the patient survives or not and then we will be going forward with the counterfactual part of the implementation where we will be making our model explainable by in the case prediction made is that patient dies than a counter sequence of input is generated from which we can change the prediction to positive one (that he survives). The method we will be using for the counterfactual part will be 1 NN Baseline Method.
